# Privacy Policy for SPR Mind Cockpit

**Last Updated:** December 31, 2024

## 1. Introduction
SPR Mind Cockpit ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension and Mind Cockpit Dashboard handle your data.

**Core Principle:** We operate on a **"Zero Data Collection"** basis. Your data belongs to you and stays on your device.

## 2. Data Collection and Storage
We do **NOT** collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers.

### Chrome Extension
- **Local Storage:** The Extension stores your chat history (prompts and AI responses) locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`.
- **No Cloud Sync:** Data is never sent to any external server or cloud database by the Extension.
- **Purpose:** Data is stored solely for the purpose of allowing you to export it to the Mind Cockpit Dashboard for visualization.

### Mind Cockpit Dashboard (Main Site)
- **Local Processing:** When you upload your `my_prompts.json` file to the Dashboard, all processing and visualization happen locally in your browser (or your local Python environment).
- **No Persistence:** We do not save your uploaded files. Once you close the tab or refresh the page, the data is cleared from memory (unless you use the session persistence feature, which uses your browser's local session state).

## 3. Data Usage
Your data is used exclusively for:
1. Generating personal analytics (charts, word clouds, habits).
2. calculating complexity scores and categorized insights.

We do **NOT** use your data for:
- Advertising or marketing.
- Training AI models.
- Selling to third parties.

## 4. User Control
You have full control over your data:
- **Export:** You can export your data at any time via the Extension.
- **Delete:** You can clear all stored data in the Extension by clicking "Clear Data" or uninstalling the Extension.

## 5. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store support page.
