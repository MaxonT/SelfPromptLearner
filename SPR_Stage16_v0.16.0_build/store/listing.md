# Self-Prompt Reflection (SPR)

## Short description
Capture, analyze, and improve your AI prompts — privately, with export/delete controls.

## Detailed description
SPR is a lightweight browser extension + dashboard that helps you:
- Capture prompts from popular AI chat sites (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Replit)
- Sync to your own backend (Bearer token) so data stays isolated per user
- Search/filter/tag prompts and review analysis (taxonomy, scores, suggestions)
- Export your data (JSON/CSV) or delete everything anytime

## Primary use cases
- Build a personal prompt journal
- Identify recurring patterns (task types, intent, constraints)
- Spot risky prompts (prompt-injection / sensitive-data flags)
- Improve prompt clarity and reproducibility over time

## What’s included
- Extension (capture + local queue + sync)
- Dashboard (timeline, filters, details, analysis)
- Backend API + Postgres (user isolation, export/delete)
